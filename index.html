<h3>What's with all the pigeons?</h3>
<br />
<p>The theme across all the Hack Education projects: pigeons. It's a nod to the work of Harvard University behavioral psychologist B. F. Skinner. Skinner is often credited with inventing the <a href="http://teachingmachin.es">teaching machine</a>. He didn't. But he has shaped education technology immensely. Even though his theories have largely fallen out of favorite in education psychology, education technology and technology more broadly, has embraced them (often, I think, without acknowledging where their ideas came from).</p>

<p>I wrote about "<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/12/25/pigeons">The Pigeons of Ed-Tech</a>" in 2014 when I started using a pigeon as the header image on my blogs.</p>
