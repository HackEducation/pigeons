<p>"Pigeons Resist Misguided Leaders," <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/27/science/homing-pigeons-navigation.html">says The New York Times</a>.</p>

<p>The researchers found that when homing pigeon leaders go astray, the flock corrects the flight path.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"...knowledge of how the pigeons work might be useful in creating swarms of small robots for activities like search and rescue. If researchers can reduce the decision-making process of a flock to a few simple rules about who follows whom, and when, those rules might be applied to robot groups."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, we'll use pigeons to shape how we build robots. Of course we will.</p>
