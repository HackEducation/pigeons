<blockquote>
<p>The motivations behind pigeon- vs. people-focused hostile architecture are, of course, different. So are the effects. But, Savic says, both &#8220;are part of the same principle of hard-coded exclusion,&#8221; in that they both assume that the best solution to a potential conflict is forcing the bird or human to find another place to be. In Savic&#8217;s view, focusing on anti-bird measures &#8220;[can] show, sometimes more clearly, how the policy of moving the problem somewhere else operates on urban space.&#8221;</p>
