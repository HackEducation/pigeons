<p>&#8220;Pigeons Are Secretly Brilliant Birds That Understand Space and Time, Study Finds,&#8221; <a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/519254/pigeons-are-secretly-brilliant-birds-understand-space-and-time-study-finds">reads the Mental Floss headline</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Researchers at the University of Iowa set up an experiment where they showed pigeons a computer screen featuring a static horizontal line. The birds were supposed to evaluate the length of the line (either 6 centimeters or 24 centimeters) or the amount of time they saw it (either 2 or 8 seconds). The birds perceived &#8220;the longer lines to have longer duration, and lines longer in duration to also be longer in length,&#8221; according to a press release. This suggests that the concepts are processed in the same region of the brains &#8211; as they are in the brains of humans and other primates.</p>

<p>But pigeons don&#8217;t have a parietal cortex, which is where humans process their abstract thinking. The scientists did not explain how the pigeons were able to accomplish this. Probably magic.</p>
