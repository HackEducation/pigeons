<p>On September 22, I presented a keynote at the Designs on eLearning conference on pigeons and cyborgs. You can find the full transcript of the talk <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2016/09/22/pigeon">here</a>.</p>

<p>An excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Training pigeons, whether for military service or otherwise, has a long history; studying this training, investigating how teaching and learning works for pigeons has been a main area of focus for the field of psychology, as it was developed and institutionalized in the twentieth century.</p>
<br />
<p>One cannot talk about education psychology without talking about pigeons. One cannot talk about education technology without talking about education psychology. One cannot talk about education technology without talking about pigeons. </p>
