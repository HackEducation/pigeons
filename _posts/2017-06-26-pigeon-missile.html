<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/06/a-pigeon-piloted-bomb-odd-powders-and-cryptic-science-ars-goes-to-nist/">Ars Technica visits the National Institute of Standards and Technology</a>.</p>

<p>Among the items on display:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Straight back from the lobby, through a sun-filled hallway, is the museum and the NIST library that&#8217;s open 24&#8211;7. There are somewhere in the ballpark of 200 items on display, with around 1,300 more in storage. The first that comes into view is a World War II-era glide bomb that was &#8211; no joke &#8211; originally designed to be piloted by pigeons.</p>

<p>No mention of Skinner. But I&#8217;m making a mental note to visit some time.</p>
