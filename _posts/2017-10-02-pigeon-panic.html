<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/1/16373086/pigeon-panic-chase-birds-apple-arkit-ar-app">The Verge has coverage of a new video game</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fgb%2Fapp%2Fid1272651887%3Fmt%3D8">Pigeon Panic</a>. The coverage isn't due to the pigeons; it's due to the app's use of Apple's new augmented reality ARKit.</p>

<blockquote><p>The premise of Pigeon Panic is simple: you throw random bits of food like pizza, donuts, and other greasy bits of goodness indiscriminately at the screen to attract the virtual birds. Once they congregate like the filthy flying rats they are, you scare them off by running into them. The quicker you do so, and the more you attract and scare, the higher your score.</p></blockquote>

<p>The app is free, so just like a pigeon, I clicked on "buy now."</p>
