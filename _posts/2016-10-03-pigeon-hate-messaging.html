<p>The pigeon's flight across the India-Pakistan border follows incidents last week of balloons with "malicious messages."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Notably residents of border village spread across the Radcliff Line have a common hobby of pigeon flying and spotting of Pakistani pigeons in Indian villages is a common phenomenon. However, sometimes mischievous elements across the border use pigeons to spread hate messages as in this case.</p>
