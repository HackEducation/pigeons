<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2018/03/02/feature/the-silicon-valley-elites-latest-status-symbol-chickens/?utm_term=.4577064cffaa">Via The Washington Post</a>: &#8220;The Silicon Valley elite&#8217;s latest status symbol: Chickens.&#8221; Raising chickens isn&#8217;t shocking. Folks do it everywhere, particularly when they&#8217;re trying to perform &#8220;back-to-the-land&#8221; and &#8220;sustainable&#8221; lifestyles in the face of middle class, suburban malaise. But the subheader on this story points to how this might be a different sort of trend: &#8220;Their pampered birds wear diapers and have personal chefs &#8211; but lay the finest eggs tech money can buy.&#8221; </p>

<p>The birds, the story says, are considered members of the family and can live up to 20 years. No word if they&#8217;re trained like pigeons.</p>
