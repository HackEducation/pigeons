<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/are-australias-native-pigeons-sitting-ducks-79428">Are Australia's native pigeons sitting ducks?</a>, asks The Conversation.</p>

<p>The story explores the 130+ species of pigeons native to Australia. This includes some of the most beautiful pigeons on the planet, if I say so myself. Note: there are no pigeons native to North America. The pigeon species most familiar to people, the rock pigeon, is a feral domesticated pigeon, and some scientists fear that these might spread disease to the native columbids.</p>
