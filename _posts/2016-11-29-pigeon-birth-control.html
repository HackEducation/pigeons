<p>Pigeons in Barcelona are being put on birth control. From <a href="http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/32932/20161128/barcelona-puts-pigeons-contraception.htm">Nature World News</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The birds will be fed contraceptive food to put contraceptive pills into the birds' system. It is expected that by mid of 2017, special feeding dispensers will be installed all over the city which contain contraceptive food. The Barcelona government has considered expert advice to successfully perform the operation without harming the birds. Results will be analyzed after the first year to see how the new "feeding system" will affect the general health of the pigeons. It is also going to be checked whether or not such an operation will be fatal to pigeons. The operation is expected to cut down the pigeons' population by as much as 80 percent in the next five years.</p>
