<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4853928/Police-shoot-pigeon-carrying-drugs.html">From The Daily Mail</a>: "Prison guards shoot dead a PIGEON smuggling marijuana into Argentinian prison using a bag strapped to its back."</p>

<p>The story claims that the bird was released alongside a pigeon-fancier event, in the hopes that its flight would not be noticed.</p>

<p>Poor pigeon. Just doing what it was trained to do.</p>
