<p>Via The Wimmera Times, "<a href="http://www.mailtimes.com.au/story/4322064/pigeon-racings-new-generation-photos/">Horsham Homing Club member Brydon McPhee keeps the pigeon racing spirit alive at age eight</a>."</p>

<p>There are a handful of very cute photos of Brydon and his pigeons.</p>

<p>The spirit might stay alive thanks to youngsters like Brydon picking up the hobby, but it also remains a sport for men.</p>
