<p>So, you&#8217;re one of the lucky few who has a &#8220;Be Less Pigeon&#8221; sticker on your laptop. Or you&#8217;re sporting a new &#8220;Be Less Pigeon&#8221; t-shirt. And someone asks you &#8220;what&#8217;s up with the pigeon?&#8221; </p>

<p>And you&#8217;re stumped. You know it&#8217;s something about education technology and technologies and pedagogies of liberation, but you can&#8217;t quite explain it.</p>

<p>Try this:</p>

<p><em>&#8220;The pigeon is the mascot of my friend Audrey Watters&#8217; website, Hack Education. She writes about education technology. The pigeon is a nod to the work of education psychologist B. F. Skinner and his experiments on pigeons and behavioral control &#8211; experiments he later expanded to use on children and &#8216;teaching machines.&#8217; &#8216;Be less pigeon&#8217; means I want both technology and education to &#8216;be less manipulative.&#8217; It&#8217;s really not an insult against pigeons though. Pigeons are amazing.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Then you can follow up with a fun pigeon fact:</p>

<ul>
<li>Did you know that pigeons and doves are the same bird family?</li>
<li>Did you know that Skinner developed pigeon-guided missiles in World War II?</li>
<li>Did you know that a pigeon was the first to deliver the message to the Allies that D Day had been successful?</li>
<li>Did you know that pigeons are not native species in the US &#8211; that they&#8217;re feral ancestors of escaped domesticated rock doves first brought here by the French in 1606?</li>
<li>Did you know humans domesticated the rock pigeon some 5000 years ago, and these birds have been a &#8220;companion species&#8221; for us ever since?</li>
<li>Did you know that pigeons were first described in <em>The New York Times</em> as &#8220;rats with wings&#8221; in 1966?</li>
</ul>

<p>You&#8217;re welcome.</p>

<p>(Or rather, thank you for supporting Hack Education by sporting the pigeon schwag.)</p>
