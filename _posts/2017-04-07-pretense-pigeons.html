<p>From an article published by the Smithsonian Libraries, "<a href="https://blog.library.si.edu/2017/03/publishing-pretense-pigeons-case-madame-knip/#.WOXfIpGkqf1">Publishing, Pretense, and Pigeons: The Case of Madame Knip</a>":</p> 

<blockquote>
<p>It is unfortunate that Madame Knip is now better remembered for her "sundry alterations" to Les Pigeons than for her beautiful art. But perhaps her story of pigeon-based subterfuge will make you consider your grey feathered friends in a different light!</p>
